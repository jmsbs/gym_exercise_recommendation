The idea of this project is to create a recommendation based algorithm built on top of a gym exercise dataset.
The goal for v1 release is to have a model that will recommend exercises based on user level (beginner, intermediate, advanced), type of exercise/training, equipment available and body part. 
For the v2 release, I'd like to have some user information/profiles in a way that a content-based and collaborative filtering.
For the v3 release, I'm aiming to have a frontend webapp/mobile app users can interact with.
For the v4 release, the goal is to also include meal planning. Users will be suggested meals based on their weight, age, body-type and gym goal (getting more swollen, losing weight, etc).
